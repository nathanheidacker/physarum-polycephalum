As the complexity of an organism increases--and especially as cognitive capacities arise--the difficulty and intricacy of this process increases in equal measure. In contrast, progression in the opposite direction conjures images of something approximating a purely chemical or even physical process. For the most basic forms of life, osmosis and movements across a chemical gradient alone may be sufficient to explain their ability to endure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are exceptions to this generalization, however, and modern science has yet to articulate a set of rules that can completely explain the complex behaviors of these otherwise simple organisms. Perhaps the most prevalent example of this biological irregularity is </span><span class="c8 c11">Physarum Polycephalum</span><span class="c2">, a type of slime-mold that exhibits remarkably intelligent behaviors in its quest for self-preservation. Despite having no cognition or central nervous system to speak of, P.

Polycephalum using a set of distributed rules has become a relatively hot topic among a number of disparate disciplines. Biologists, mathematicians, and computer scientists alike have all contributed to the growing body of research that exists to discover the explanation for this unprecedented ability. Among that research, the greatest commonality that exists is the idea that the behavior is the consequence of a set of rules executed in a distributed fashion; intelligent pathfinding must be an emergent consequence of the implementation of some ruleset, executed by a simple biological network. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c9">Prior Research</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">A number of competing theories have been proposed to explain the behaviors of P. Polycephalum, most of which vary wildly in their domain of scientific origin. Notably, there have been attempts to model the slime mold with sets of differential equations, distributed systems, </span><span class="c8">and series</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of complex biochemical processes (Bonifaci, 2012). While some of these models produce results with some visual similarity, none have been able to act as valid explanations for the internal processes that dictate P. Polycephalum&rsquo;s behavior.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my development of this model, rather than focusing on the implementation of a single ruleset, I opted to construct a set of mechanisms that borrowed from throughout the literature. Combining different methods in this way allowed me to push beyond the bounds of previous research that generated these networks computationally. The rules that I eventually settled on using in the model were primarily derived from just two research papers, both of which address very different aspects of the model&rsquo;s behavior. Accordingly, I find it most practical to introduce their influences on the model serially, as this implementation order is reflected in the model&rsquo;s development.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c9">Physarum Polycephalum Network Generation</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When exploring its environment, P. Polycephalum constructs a network of cytoskeletal tubes responsible for carrying the cytoplasmic fluid that acts as a nutrient and information transport network (Alim, Jones). The general process of forming these reticulated tubes in itself can be considered the first emergent behavior, requiring the interaction of thousands of agents that simulate the movement of cytoplasmic fluid particles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because a realistic fluid simulation would require the simultaneous computation of millions of particles, each agent instead represents a particular volume of fluid. This is accomplished by making agents emit a certain amount of fluid at each time step at their current position, which both dissipates and diffuses across the environment with time. Rates of fluid dissipation and diffusion (which collectively represent the total volume of fluid that any one agent can represent) allow a vast degree of control over the type, shape, and strength of structures that the network forms. </span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2">Fluid particles are simulated by attaching a set of 3 sensors to the front of each agent. Each sensor measures the concentration of fluid ahead of the agent at a constant distance, which can be modulated to generate different network structures (Fig. 2). For the purposes of this model it is most accurate to use lower distances (~1 patch) because fluid particles have no &lsquo;vision&rsquo; to speak of and are not actively sensing the environment ahead of them, but rather traveling in the direction of the fluid concentration gradient. Owing to similarly physics-based intuitions, fluid particle sensors only face forward; the movement of the fluid particle should be roughly restricted to the direction of its current momentum. Fluid particles can turn around completely, but it will take several time steps in order to do so.</span></p><p class="c15"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 450.50px; height: 313.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 376.00px; height: 313.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c16 c19"><span class="c5">Fig. 2.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp; &nbsp;Agent sensor architecture, modulated by the angle between sensors and the distance offset (Jones, 2010).</span></p><p class="c19 c3 c16"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2">Sensors perform a comparative measurement to determine the gradient of fluid concentration in a cone determined by the sensors&rsquo; positions. Agents then reorient themselves in the direction of this gradient, and apply a smaller but randomly determined rotation from that new heading. This random rotation or &lsquo;wobble&rsquo; represents fluid turbulence, and its strength is the primary determinant of the slime-mold&rsquo;s proclivity to create new branches along a tube rather than continue along those that already exist. </span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c8">This framework for physarum polycephalum network generation visually emulates the real phenomenon quite accurately. However, having the fluid agents represent both the cytoplasmic fluid and the cytoskeleton tube network rather than emulating them as distinct entities is a simplification that imposes some limitations on the temporal quality of the model. In a static sense, the model produces visualizations that are strikingly similar to real physarum networks, but viewed over time they are too malleable and overly dynamic, even without provocation from any kind of stimulus. In real physarum networks, fluid flows influence the formation of cytoskeleton tubes in a similar fashion, but the differences in the temporal resolution of the fluid and the cytoskeletal materials allows the network to reflect responses to local fluid changes over a much larger course of time. Because the model uses the cytoplasmic fluid </span><span class="c8 c11">as</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;the cytoskeleton, they share the same temporal qualities, and the result is a model that adapts to its own circumstances too rapidly.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Network Reactions to Nutritive Stimuli</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">In the presence of a nutritive stimulus, P. Polycephalum will release a signaling chemical that is advected by the cytoplasmic fluid flows of the network, inducing the release of more signaling </span><span class="c8">chemical</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;elsewhere in the network. This signaling chemical induces greater fluid flow into the regions of the network that it reaches, subsequently increasing both tube strength and fluid velocity within the tube (Alim, 2017). Tubes that are affected by the chemical therefore experience hypertrophy as they grow in size and require more of the network&rsquo;s limited supply of cytoplasmic fluid. Because the total volume of fluid in the network is limited, paths that are unaffected by the signaling chemical experience atrophy as less fluid is available to flow through them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To implement this into the model, fluid particles in the presence of food gain a scalar attribute corresponding to the strength of the signaling molecule that they now carry throughout the network. This chemical signal spreads to other fluid particles in the network, conditioned on the distance between them. For each agent carrying the signal, the signal strength is decremented by some constant value at each timestep. Fluid agents carrying the signal are more attractive than their non-signal-carrying counterparts, and therefore induce additional fluid flow to their respective locality. Consequently, tubes that carry the signal experience growth, and tubes that do not carry the signal experience atrophy. Network refinement occurs as some tubes are too weak to maintain themselves and simply die out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This aspect of the model&rsquo;s design also contains some simplifications, some of which are a consequence of the previous design choices relating to network generation. Most prominently, the lack of explicit simulation of cytoskeleton tubes means that the modality of chemical signal propagation carried out by real P. Polycephalum is impossible. In real slime-mold networks, the propulsion of cytoplasmic fluid is carried out by peristaltic contractions of the tube network (Alim, 2017). When the signaling molecule affects the network, it affects the contractional amplitude of these tubes, affecting the rate of fluid propulsion and subsequent tube growth. Because my model only simulates fluid particles, transmission of the signal must be carried out by the fluid, and fluid particles move constantly rather than on the basis of a peristaltic contraction that is carried out by the entire network in waves. These simplifications impose limitations on the ability of the network to impose more permanent changes on the tube structure in response to nutritive stimuli, as it will readapt too quickly once the stimulus is removed. Additionally, transmitting the signal through the fluid particles instead of the tube structure is an inferior selection mechanism for the shortest path, as it tends to spread too liberally within the vicinity of the stimulus and reinforce paths that it shouldn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Analysis and Discussion</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manipulation of model parameters that determine total network fluid volume allow for the production of vastly different network structures. Modulating rate of dissipation changes average tube strength, increasing the both average and total fluid concentration of the network (Fig. 3).</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 126.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 126.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Fig. 3. &nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Visualization of varying total network fluid volume parameter from 10% to 90%, with increments of 20% increasing from left to right.
